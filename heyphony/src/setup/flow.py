"""the guided setup, in two shapes at once: a menu for a person, flags for a process.

`heyphony setup select sip` walks three small choices - provider, then whether the did already
exists or has to be ordered, then the number itself - and prints the exact connect command with
the parts a human still has to fetch from the dashboard marked.

the same module answers to flags, because the caller is often not a person: every menu is also a
key in the data, and a non-tty run with missing answers returns the next question as json instead
of blocking on a prompt. that is what makes setup operatable by an agent, not just readable by one.
